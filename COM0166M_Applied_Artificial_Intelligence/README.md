# COM00166M Applied Artificial Intelligence

* Week 1: We start the module with a look at artificial intelligence and the philosophy of the mind.
* Week 2: This week covers local searches and metaheuristics, looking at some basic concepts including exhaustive or blind searches and introducing heuristics.
* Week 3: This week continues with search algorithms, looking at basic local searches and the Steepest Ascent Hill-Climbing algorithm.
* Week 4: This week looks at strategies used to address drawbacks seen in local search methods including Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search.
* Week 5: Genetic algorithms are introduced in this week and we examine their origins and uses.
* Week 6: This week neural networks are discussed, and in particular, machine learning with neural networks.
* Week 7: This last week focusses on deep learning with a look at Large Language Models and also consider some of the ethical issues associated with artificial intelligence.

At the end of this module students will be able to:
* Select and apply appropriate AI algorithms and methodologies, with consideration for optimisation and scale to meet business objectives and performance targets.
* Critically evaluate AI-methodologies through experimental design, exploratory modelling, and hypothesis testing.
* Critically analyse techniques for the extraction of data from systems, ensuring standards of data quality and consistency for processing by AI-systems.
* Identify and discuss appropriate application areas and problems for current AI techniques, such as: neural network, deep learning, genetic algorithms and local search approaches.
