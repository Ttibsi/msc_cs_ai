# Wk 1 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

* Analyse the goals and purpose of artificial intelligence, and distinctions between approaches such as acting rationally and simulating human behaviour. [MLO 4]
* Explain how  ’Lady Lovelace’s objection’, ’The Turing Test’ and ‘The Chinese Room’ are relevant to the question of whether machines can think. [MLO 4]
* Articulate the arguments for and against weak AI and strong AI. [MLO 4]
* Identify some of the methods of current AI research and be able to give examples of their application in state-of-the-art AI systems. [MLO 4]

### Lesson 1 - What is Artificial Intelligence
Intelligence - the power of learning, understanding and reasoning.
    * includes reasoning and other areas
    * However a lot of our understanding is "human intelligence" and may not apply to machines

Functions of natural intelligence
* recieving inputs from senses
* interpreting sensory input (processing)
* storing and retrieval of information
* controlling motor functions (output)
* communicating
* reasoning and problem solving
* original and creative thought (generation)

Computers are good at
* performing complex and repetitive calculations accurately efficiently and consistently
* Gathering, collating, storing, manipulating, analysing and retrieving data
* searching through large quantities of data

People are good at - spontaneous and creative thought.

Multiple definitions for AI - an ongoing debate between rationalists and humanists
* think or act rationally
* think or act like a human

#### Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, Fourth Edition. Chapter 1, sections 1.1 to 1.2. 
To pass the turing test, an AI loosely needs the four following capabilities:
* natural langauge processing - to communicate in a human language
* knowledge representation - to store what it knows or hears
* automated reasoning - to answer questions and draw new conclusions
* machine learning - to adapt to new circumstances and detect/extrapolate patterns

researchers have also proposed the next two requirements for interaction with 
the real world, a "total turing tests"
* computer vision and speech recognition
* robotics to manipulate objects and move in the real world

Computer Agents are programs that are expected to do more -- operate autonomously
persive their environment, persist over a long time 

Value Alignment probme - the values or objectives put into the machine must 
align with those of the humans involved. EX in a self-driving car, how fast to
drive, how to mitigate risk etc

Philosophy of AI study
* can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions
* how does the mind arise from the physical brain
* where does knowledge come from
* How does knowledge lead to action

### Lesson 2 - Is AI Possible?
Ada Lovelace and the analytical engine
    - Babbage's analytical engine was basically a steam-powered computer
    - Babbage built the hardware, Lovelace wrote what amounted to the software
    - the machine was never finished as Babbage ran out of money

    - Lovelace argued that their machine was not capable of original ideas

Turing's 1950 responce
* Turing had two counter arguments to Lovelace
* 1 - in practice, the result of programming often surprises us
    * Turning notes that Lovelace never ran any of her programs
* 2 - The possibility that machines could be programmed to learn

Weak AI - machines that only are acting like they are intelligent
Strong AI - the assertion that machines are actually consciously thinking
    - also known as "human-level AI" or "general AI"
