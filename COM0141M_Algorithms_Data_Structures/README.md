# COM00141M Algorithms & Data Structures

* Week 1: Introduction to Algorithms, problem solving, and writing your first program.
* Week 2: Introduction to Data Structures, search and programming flow-control structures.
* Week 3: Pseudo-code, Asymptotic analysis, Big-O notation and use of function in programming.
* Week 4: Basic linear abstract data structures and their implementations using classes and  data encapsulation.
* Week 5: Non linear data structure: Trees and their application to search algorithms. Recursion.
* Week 6:  Sorting algorithms and Divide and  Conquer algorithmic strategies. Handling errors in a program.
* Week 7: Non-linear data structure: Graphs, how to implement and traverse them.

At the end of this module students will be able to:
* Express a problem solution algorithmically using pseudo-code
* Analyse time complexity of an algorithm
* Construct computer programs to implement algorithms
* Test a computer program against the specification
