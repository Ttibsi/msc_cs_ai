# Wk 2 - Essential concepts

* Explain what a Data Structure is and its relationship with the algorithms. [MLO1]
* Identify which Data Structure is better suited for a given problem. [MLO1]
* Explain what search-efficient Data Structures are.  [MLO1]
* Compare and contrast  linear search and a binary search. [MLO1]
* Implement  Python control-flow Structures. [MLO3]

Sets - collection of distinct items
Trees - hierarchical relationships
Permutations - arrangements, applied to problems involving ordering
    - Permutations of a sequence of elements are every possible order of that sequence
    - ex {1,2,3,4} and {4,3,2,1} are two possible permutations of a sequence of four numbers
