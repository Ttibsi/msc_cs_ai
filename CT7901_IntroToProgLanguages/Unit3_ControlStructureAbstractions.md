# Control Structure Abstractions in Python
* Explain the abstractions of a statement in a programming language
* Classify decisions statements of programming languages
* Classify looping statements of programming languages
* Explain the abstraction of a subprogram in programming languages
* Explain the abstraction of a module in programming languages

### Lesson 1
* A statement executes the commands it encloses and then transfers control of 
execution to the next statement
* An expression does not execute any commands, instead evaluating to a value.
* A compound statement or set of instructions are generally structured as a 
block which defiend a lexical scope
* Interupts and signals are low-level mechanisms that can alter the flow of 
control asyncronously. 
* Statements in python are terminated by an EOL/Carriage Return symbol.
* Compound statements include looping and decision statements

### Lesson 2

### Lesson 3
* Parts of a for loop
