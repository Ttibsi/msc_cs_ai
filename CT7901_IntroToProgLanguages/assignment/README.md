# Applied Learning Assignment

The Applied Learning Assignment (ALA) for this module is to create a 
presentation for the case study company of Global E-Learning Teaching Machine 
Software Inc (geltmSoft). There are 5 parts to the ALA, which correspond to 
each of the 5 Units of study. At the end of each Unit, you will create a 5 
minute presentation that forms part of the overall presentation for geltmSoft.

### Case Study

You had quite a bit of experience in computer programming languages and their 
design. That is why you were hired as a Team Leader for a startup software 
company geltmSoft (Global E-Learning Teaching Machine Software), Inc., that 
creates learning management software applications for the education industry.   

The CIO, who hired you, wants you to lead a group of software developers to 
assess the feasibility of creating a new programming language specifically 
for developing learning management software applications in the education 
industry.  

The only thing that geltmSoft, Inc. completed in developing this new language 
was to select a name for it which is geltmSoftLang. The CIO said that 
geltmSoft, Inc. does not have experience in the design of programming languages, 
and she wants you to develop a series of presentations to your team about 
possible choices of the elements of the geltmSoftLang programming language.   

You will be asked to complete progressive assignments throughout this course 
relating to your geltmSoftLang element choices and how you represent them to 
your team. You can self-assess your assignment work using the provided rubrics.
