# Introduction to Programming Languages
* MLO1 - Examine the origins, purposes, types, and environment of programming languages
* MLO2 - Appraise the various data type abstractions in programming languages
* MLO3 - Appraise the various control structure abstractions in programming languages
* MLO4 - Appraise different programming paradigms and their major concepts
* MLO5 - Justify how the advanced features of programming languages are used, such as pointers, retypes, polymorphism, exceptions and concurrency

### Module Description
In this module, you will be introduced to the origins of
programming languages and how they have evolved over the
years. You will learn about abstractions in programming
languages, including both data type abstractions and control
structure abstractions. You will study how different
programming languages, like Java and Lisp, implement these
abstractions and the programming paradigms to which these
languages belong. In addition, you will learn about advanced
features of programming languages, such as exceptions and
polymorphism and the purpose of these advanced features.
